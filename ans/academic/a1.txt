Title: "Navigating the Digital Divide: An Exploratory Study on the Relationship between AI-Enabled Mental Health Support and Social Isolation in Young Adults"

Abstract:

This mixed-methods study investigates the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled mental health support on social isolation among young adults. A total of 200 participants aged 18-25 were recruited through online surveys and social media platforms. Participants received either AI-powered chatbot-based support or a traditional, human-assisted therapy approach. The results show that those who received the AI-enabled support reported lower levels of social isolation and improved mental well-being compared to those in the control group. Additionally, thematic analysis of survey responses revealed insights into how participants perceived the benefits and limitations of AI-supported mental health services. These findings suggest that AI-powered interventions can be an effective tool for mitigating social isolation and promoting mental health among young adults.
