In whispers of the wind, trees stand tall,
Their leaves a gentle rustle, through it all.
The sun's warm touch ignites their skin,
A fiery glow, that banishes within.

The forest floor, a carpet soft and deep,
A haven for creatures, in slumber keep.
The birds awake, with sweet melodic song,
As morning dawns, the day is strong.

The river flows, a winding stream,
Through rocks and trees, its path does gleam.
The fish swim by, with scales of blue,
Their world a mystery, for me and you.

The mountains rise, a towering height,
A challenge to climbers, in the still of night.
The air is crisp, with scents so sweet,
A fragrance that the senses greet.

In nature's arms, we find our peace,
A sense of calm, our worries release.
So let us cherish, this world we live,
And honor its beauty, for all it gives.
